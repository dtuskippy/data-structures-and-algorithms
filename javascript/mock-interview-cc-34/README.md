# Mock Interview -- Code Challenge 34

## Reflections

* I chose the function that will determine if the given string is full of unique characters.
* This problem was similar to the repeated word code challenge earlier in the week (the other challenge was also in the same category).
* The solution is fairly easy to understand conceptually, and reminds me of similar problems involving simpler structures without employing the use of a hash table.
* I think the rough walk through of the problem is fairly straightforward, but new data structures always make me think twice when I am 'getting it too easy' right away.
* I tend to still think in terms of objects, arrays and functions with for and while loops, i.e. simpler and more familiar structures a bit more burned into my brain, and DSA always makes me 'pump fake' when I am about to plow towards an answer.
