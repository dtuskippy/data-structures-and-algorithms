# Trees -- Code Challenge 15

* Node
  * Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

## Code Challenge 15

* Binary Tree
  * Create a Binary Tree class
  * Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
    * pre order
    * in order
    * post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
* Binary Search Tree
  * Create a Binary Search Tree class
  * This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
    * Add
      * Arguments: value
      * Return: nothing
      * Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
    * Contains
      * Argument: value
      * Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.*

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- * The full coding challenge took approximately 8 hours to complete, including reading, reviewing a video, writing the actual code for methods and the testing. -->
