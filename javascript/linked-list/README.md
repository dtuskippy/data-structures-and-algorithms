# Singly Linked List -- Code Challenge 06

* Node
  * Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

* Linked List
  * Create a Linked List class
  * Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
  * Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

## Code Challenge 06

The class should contain the following methods:

* insert
  * Arguments: value
  * Returns: nothing
  * Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
* includes
  * Arguments: value
  * Returns: Boolean
  * Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
* to string
  * Arguments: none
  * Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
  * "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency

* The full coding challenge took approximately 8 hours to complete, including reading, reviewing a video, writing the actual code for methods and the testing.
