# Singly Linked List -- Code Challenge 06

* Node
  * Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

* Linked List
  * Create a Linked List class
  * Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
  * Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

## Code Challenge 06

The class should contain the following new methods (extending on Code Challenge 05):

* append
  * arguments: new value
  * adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
* insert before
  * arguments: value, new value
  * adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
* insert after
  * arguments: value, new value
  * adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Approach & Efficiency

* The full coding challenge took approximately 4 hours to complete, mainly spent on writing the actual code for methods and the associated testing.
